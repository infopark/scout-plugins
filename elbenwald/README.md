Scout-Plugin for watching the number of "healthy" instances available on an AWS-ELB.


## Installation

* Copy [the source](https://raw.github.com/infopark/scout-elbenwald/master/elbenwald.rb)
* Create a new private plugin in Scout-GUI
* Paste the code

Refer to https://scoutapp.com/info/creating_a_plugin

## Usage

### Options

* `elb_name` - (required) Name of the ELB
* AWS config (credential, region) has to be provided by `/etc/scout/plugins/elbenwald.yml`

### Metrics and error log

It provides a count of healthy instance for an ELB for a availability zone.
For example if you have an ELB `My-ELB` which has 1 healthy instance available in zone `eu-west-1a`
and one unhealthy and 2 healthy instances available in zone `eu-west-1b`,
then following metrics will be generated:

```json
"Eu-west-1a" 1.0
"Eu-west-1b" 2.0
"Total"      3.0
"Average"    1.5
"Minimum"    1.0
```

Each unhealthy instance will be notices in the error log (`/var/log/scout/plugins/elbenwald.log`) like this:

`[0000-01-01 00:00:00 +0100] [My-ELB] [eu-west-1b] [iabc123] [Doesn't feel good...]`

## Development
